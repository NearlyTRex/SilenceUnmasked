## Readme

# About
Silence Unmasked is a graphic horror adventure game which uses a point-and-click interface.

# Premise
Sarah is searching for information about her real parents and ends up stuck in something worse than her darkest nightmare.

# Story
As she is searching for information about her real family, her car ends up getting into an accident, stranding her in the middle of a snowstorm.  The only thing near her is a strange mansion and its surrounding estate.  Forced to look for help and a way of leaving, she explores the mansion, finding out that it does indeed have a connection to her past.  It's only inhabitant seems to be the old delusional caretaker.  However, she also runs afoul of a psychotic killer, someone who seems to mainly move along the shadows, stalking her and waiting for a moment to strike...

# Features
Needing to find a means of escape and survival, Sarah must somehow make it through the night alive. The player must explore the house, solve puzzles, escape the stalker, and find out more about her past.  To do this, items can be picked up and used, and areas of each room could be used as a potential hiding place.  Based on what the player does or does not do, the ending of the game will differ slightly.

# Exploration
At the core, Silence Unmasked is an adventure game, and puts much emphasis on exploration and solving puzzles.  This gives players a mental challenge if they want to explore more and learn more of the story.

# Survival
Coupled with the adventure/exploration component is an action component, where an enemy is constantly stalking the main character.  There is no way to fight back directly, so the player must be quick witted and find appropriate places to hide in order to survive.

# Environment
The atmosphere of the game is gothic and dark, presented in a black and white visual format similar to many horror stories of old.  There is a presence of impending doom and isolation, with the fear of the unknown around every corner.  Sound and music also serve to create this ambiance and draw the player into the world that Sarah faces.
